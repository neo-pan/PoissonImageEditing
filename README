# Poisson Image Editing

This project re-implements various Poisson image editing techniques as described in the paper "Poisson Image Editing" by Pérez et al. (2003).

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

There are 5 scripts that implement different editing functions:

### Seamless Cloning

```
python seamless_clone.py --help
```

Clone an object from a source image to a target image seamlessly.

### Texture Flattening 

```
python texture_flatten.py --help  
```

Flatten textures while retaining prominent edges.

### Local Illumination Changes

```
python local_illumination_change.py --help
```

Modify illumination levels in a selected region.

### Local Color Changes

```
python local_color_change.py --help
``` 

Alter colors in a region or select objects by color.

### Seamless Tiling

```
python seamless_tile.py --help
```

Create a tileable texture from an image.

Each script accepts common parameters such as source and target images, as well as a mask. However, in certain tasks, the target or mask may not be used.

## Examples

Some sample outputs are provided in `imgs/`.
